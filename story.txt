"He's awake," he heard, muffled through the wall to his right. "I never thought
it would work... he's been asleep for 40 years!" the voice continued, in
growing enthusiasm. Still confused, disconnected fragments of memory began to

feeling that they were some how important. Before he could try to focus on the
fragment of his memory, some one came into the room where he was, or at least

of the room was further emphasized by the glaringly bright lights in the ceiling.
